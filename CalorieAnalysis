[Project Link](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/1102888a-c9cf-4ab6-ad09-192bd6e1dcee?ctid=8644cd89-6ec4-47c4-9147-055c60b5ada2&pbi_source=linkShare)
## Project Overview

This project explores the relationships between exercise types, workout frequency, stress, and their effects on calorie burning and physical performance. Using interactive data visualization in Power BI, the study highlights trends and insights within the dataset. Key objectives include:

- Analyzing the impact of age, gender, workout type, and session duration on calorie burning.
- Investigating BMI, body fat percentage, and workout frequency relationships.
- Understanding how stress influences calorie burning.

## Project Steps

1. **Analyze the Provided Data Model**  
   Understand the dataset to address the listed objectives effectively.
   
2. **Design and Implement Visualizations**  
   Create intuitive visualizations to explore trends and answer key questions.

3. **Link Data Sources**  
   Integrate datasets to uncover correlations between stress levels and calories burned.
